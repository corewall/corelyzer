        The CoreWall Suite is a collaborative development for a
        real-time stratigraphic correlation, core description (CD) and
        data visualization system to be used by the marine, terrestrial 
        and Antarctic science communities. The development will be
        carried out in broad collaboration with stakeholders in these
        science communities.
      </p><p>
        To ensure that the software development does not occur independent of
        related IT activities, in particular, the development of the
        U.S. IODP-Phase 2 Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel (SODV), a Steering
        Committee will be constituted. The Steering Committee will be
        comprised of key U.S. IODP and related database (e.g., CHRONOS, SedDB)
        developers and users as well as representatives of other core-based
        enterprises (e.g., ANDRILL, ICDP, LacCore). Data will be made
        available directly from the numerous hard rock and sediment databases
        or through access provided by a portal such as CHRONOS. CoreWall's
        software displays section images from one or more cores along with
        discrete data streams and nested images to provide a robust approach
        to the description of sediment cores. Split-core surface images are
        the fundamental template of sediment descriptive work. Loaded
        horizontally and viewed in high resolution along a sliding plane,
        features such as lithologic variation, macroscopic grain size
        variation, bioturbation intensity, chemical composition and
        micropaleontology are easier to interpret and annotate.
      </p><p>
        In particular, the CoreWall Suite will incorporate the new Correlator
        software, the updated version of CLIP (e.g. Sagan and Splicer) that
        was developed by the Lamont group more than 10 years ago, into a new
        portable visualization tool that will work across multiple platforms
        and interact seamlessly with both JANUS (ODP's relational database),
        CHRONOS, PetDB, SedDB, dbSEABED and other databases. This
        functionality will result in a CoreWall Suite module that can be used
        and distributed anywhere for stratigraphic and age correlation
        tasks. The versatility and flexibility of these enhanced software
        tools will allow geoscientists to integrate shipboard data entered
        into the JANUS database with third-party analyses of samples distributed
        to other scientists or generated by other programs and projects. While
        doing this, we will abstract the functional algorithms that drive
        NCLIP into software libraries that will be used in the CoreWall Suite
        so that they are available for other software development projects
        that want to build on these modules. In this way, the critical depth
        mapping functionality and enhancements that resulted in NCLIP will be
        integrated into the remarkable visualization capability that is
        CoreWall, which is envisioned to be at the heart of a next-generation
        suite of tools required by the IODP and other ocean science research
        programs, as well as ICDP and other terrestrial core-based research
        programs.

        CoreWall's high-resolution tiled LCD display gives geoscientists a 
        large-scale perspective, helpful in processing and comparing 
        high-resolution digital line-scan images of cores measuring up to 
        hundreds of feet long. A prototype desktop environment for 
        CoreWall is Personal GeoWall2 (PG2) , a system that uses 
        a single computer to drive four LCD panels as well as 
        a single-screen stereo GeoWall display.
