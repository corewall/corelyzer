              Command: "new-section". Arguments: "Section name", "Starting depth" in
              meters" and "Length in meters".
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The main purpose of the command is to notify to
              the server that a new core sections exists.  Effectively
              creating empty slots of split-core image and whole-core
              image entries.  This is also used so that when a new
              data comes in, there are correlations to depth intervals
              and section names.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "new-missing-section". Arguments: "Section name
              prefix", "Starting depth in meters" and "Length in meters".
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The main purpose of the command is to notify to
              the server that a new missing core sections exists.
              Effectively creating empty slots of split-core image and
              whole-core image entries.  Using command like
              &#8220;new-missing-section and001 0.0 1.5&#8221; will create a new
              section with section name &#8220;and001_0.0-1.5-missing&#8221;.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "new-split-core". Arguments: "The URL to the
              image file", "The name of the section the image comes
              from", "The DPI (dots-per-inch) of the image in X
              (horizontal) direction" and (Optional) "The DPI of the
              image in Y (vertical) direction"
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The purpose of this command is to let the
              server know the web address of the split-core image that
              was created from the core section.  This will let the
              server then notify the clients that the image exists and
              is available for download and viewing in Corelyzer.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "new-missing-split-core". Arguments: "The section name of missing split core"
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The purpose of this command is to assign a
              empty split core image to a core section due to there
              might be no split core image available but users still
              need to access the data and whole core images. The
              missing section name convention will be like
              &lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;start_depth&gt;-&lt;end_depth&gt;, eg:
              &#8220;and001_186.7-187.5&#8221;.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "new-whole-core". Arguments: "The URL to the
              image file", "The name of the section the image comes
              from" and "The DPI (dots-per-inch) of the image".

            </p><p>
              Purpose: The purpose of this command is to let the
              server know the web address of the whole-core image that
              was created from the core section.  This will let the
              server then notify the clients that the image exists and
              is available for download and viewing in Corelyzer.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "new-dataset". Arguments: "Data file to parse"
              and "The name of the dataset to append/overwrite".
            </p><p>
              Purpose: This command will parse a tab-delimited data
              file and feed the server new data tables.  The tab
              delimited data file must follow the formatting exampled
              in Appendix B.  This command will retrieve a listing of
              sections to use the depth and length of the sections to
              determine how to partition the data file into tables.  
            </p><p>
              Once the tables are created the tables are sent to the
              server and stored in a file with the following name
              convention:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
              dataset.&lt;section name&gt;.&lt;dataset name&gt;.tab
            </pre><p>
              If the dataset name does not exist in the server, it
              will be created automatically.  If the name exists then
              the files created on the server will automatically be
              appended.
            </p><p>
              NOTE: Existing files will be overwritten automatically!
              If this is an undesired effect, please make sure that
              there are no rows that contain depths of sections that
              would previously had a table made for them for the
              dataset.  If you are only appending to a single
              tab-delimited file without changing previous rows then
              the overwrite will effectively be doing nothing for
              previously created tables.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "list-sections". Arguments: None
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The purpose of this command is to list the
              existing sections known to the server.  Returned is a
              listing of section names, their depth and length in
              meters.  The output is displayed to the command-line.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "list-datasets". Arugments: None
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The purpose of this command is to display
              datasets known to the server.  Displayed are the names
              of the datasets followed by the attributes in the
              dataset and their respective minimum and maximum values
              within the whole dataset.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "list-tables". Arguments: "The name of the
              dataset"
            </p><p>
              Purpose: This command will display a listing of tables
              within a given dataset.  This is useful if you do not
              know if a given section is covered by a dataset because
              the names of the tables are the names of the sections.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "list-table-data". Arguments: "The name of the
              dataset" and "The name of the section/table to view"
            </p><p>
              Purpose: This command will display the data of a table
              from a given dataset.  The data is displayed in a
              tab-delimited form with the first line as the header
              followed by lines of numerical values.  Table cells that
              are invalid will appear blank.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "run-backup". Arguments:	None
            </p><p>
              Purpose: The server runs backups automatically if the
              last backup has occurred more than 24 hours ago.  This
              command forces the current day&#8217;s backup to occur.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "logout". Arguments: None
            </p><p>
              Purpose: This command allows the administrator to logout
              and ends the client program.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Command: "server-shutdown". Arguments: None
            </p><p>
              Purpose: This command allows the server to properly
              shutdown.
