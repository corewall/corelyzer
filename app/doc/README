--- How to Generate Corelyzer Help Files ---
LacCore/CSDCO, May 6, 2020

The help files included with Corelyzer are generated using:

http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
- DocBook XSL stylesheets.

http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/index.html
- The xsltproc command-line utility (part of the XSLT C library).
If you're running a recent version of Mac OS X, you're in luck,
it's likely already installed.

http://javahelp.java.net/
https://github.com/sorghumking/javahelp
- The JavaHelp system, required to generate the search database. sorghumking/javahelp is
my fork of https://github.com/javaee/javahelp that fixes throwing of URI exceptions.

app/doc/corelyzer.xml
- The DocBook file that contains all help text and defines help structure.


To generate help files:

1. Create JavaHelp-ready HTML files with the following command (in app/doc):

   xsltproc --stringparam section.autolabel 1 \
            --stringparam section.label.includes.component.label 1 \
            --stringparam suppress.navigation 0 \
            [DocBook root]/javahelp/javahelp.xsl corelyzer.xml

The stringparams assign section numbers, prefix those section numbers with
chapter numbers, and include the Prev/Next navigation header/footer, respectively.

app/doc should now contain several HTML files and the following JavaHelp files:
    jhelpidx.xml jhelpmap.jhm jhelpset.hs jhelptoc.xml


2. Create the JavaHelp search database (in app/doc):

   [JavaHelp root]/javahelp/bin/jhindexer *.html

app/doc should now contain a directory called JavaHelpSearch.


3. Create a single-page HTML document containing all documentation with
the following command (in app/doc):

xsltproc -o index-all.html [DocBook root]/html/docbook.xsl corelyzer.xml

(We don't want this page indexed for JavaHelp, thus we create after step #2.)

4. Copy the contents of app/doc (sans README and corelyzer.xml) to 
packages/base/help, repackage the app, and bask in the helpfulness!
